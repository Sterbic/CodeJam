# CodeJam


Python solutions to various [Google Code Jam][1] problems.

Usage can be seen by running any script `*.py` without arguments.
Usually one input argument is expected, the path to the input file,
while the solution is printed to `stdout`.

Practice input files are present in each problem subfolder and the
corresponding output can be checked with the Code Jam Judge.

All scripts are developed for Python 3 and are tested on Python 3.3.5.
